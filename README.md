## 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects motor functions, speech, and movement. Early detection of Parkinson’s Disease is essential for effective treatment and improved quality of life. This project aims to detect Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning techniques by analyzing biomedical voice measurements.

The system uses a dataset containing various voice-related features such as jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, and harmonic-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing and feature normalization, machine learning models are trained to classify individuals as Parkinson’s patients or healthy controls.

The proposed approach demonstrates reliable prediction performance and highlights the potential of machine learning as a supportive tool for early Parkinson’s Disease diagnosis in healthcare systems.
